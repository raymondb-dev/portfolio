'GoPlayOz' was the final project for my app development course. We created an application that allows users to post the location of any local sports venue. It was created out of the desire to have a stronger database of public venues for athletes to use. 

My contributions: GoPlayOz was developed in Android Studio using Java. Google Firebase was used host the 'venues' database.
