In November 2022, I went on a family vacation to the Phillipines for a wedding. If you've ever been to the Phillipines, you'll know that 50% of your time is spent at a resort and the other 50% is spent travelling to that resort. To kill the time, I subscribed to 'NYTimes Games' and was granted access to their famous Crossword. Suffice to say, I was in love! The NYT Crossword provide deeply satisfying deductions, achieved through creative clue writing and interesting crossword themes. If only I could share this joy with others...

As of writing, there is no crossword equivalent to "Words with Friends". The New Yorker offers a browser-based solution, but this comes with a bevy of compatibility issues such as shifting UI elements.  This was a huge disappointment for my partner and I, as we enjoy sharing the process of solving puzzles. We've done many escape rooms together and have a completed run through of Portal 2's co-op campaign. 

This is where "CrossPlay" (title temporary) come in. My goal is create a crossword app that allows the user to host a lobby with friends where they can collaboratively solve crosswords. This app will allow me to expand my web development skills, which are admittedly something that needs work. 

On top of this, I also want to develop an algorithm that allows users to generate NYT-style crosswords, where they can enter a limited number of words that can form themed crossword. This is tangential to the multiplayer component, but combined allow "CrossPlay" to stand apart from other apps on the market. 

Today, I started unpacking JSON crossword data I found on Github and am on my way towards developing a rudimentary crossword app. This will be a prototype used build out the fundamental components of a crossword app, and to test peer-to-peer crossword play, before using more elaborate hosting solutions. For FridgeVision, my previous iOS app, I used UIKit as it had more resources compared to its newer counterpart, SwiftUI. I decided to learn SwiftUI for the development of this application, as it would provide a change of pace and widen my personal skillset. 

I will update this blog as I continue to make progress.
