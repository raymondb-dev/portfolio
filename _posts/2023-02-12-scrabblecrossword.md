In November 2022, I went on a family vacation to the Phillipines for a wedding. If you've ever been to the Phillipines, you'll know that 50% of your time is spent at a resort and the other 50% is spent travelling to that resort. To kill the time, I subscribed to 'NYTimes Games' and was granted access to their famous Crossword. Suffice to say, I was in love! If only I could share this joy with others...

The market for crossword apps is painfully lacking at the moment.
